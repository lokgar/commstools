# CommsTools

The toolkit enables systematic research flow and Design of Experiments (DoE) in Digital Communications. Provides tools like sequence preparation, baseband signal generation, channel simulation, DSP-based signal recovery, and more, driven by configuration (YAML/Pydantic) and modular workflows to ensure reproducibility and traceability.

DSP blocks and other computation-intensive tasks are implemented using JAX for performance and GPU acceleration.

Scope: Computational tasks only (no hardware control).
