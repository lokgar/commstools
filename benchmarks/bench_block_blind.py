"""Benchmarks: blind frequency-domain equalizers (block_cma, block_rde).

The blind, phase-directed siblings of ``block_lms`` share its overlap-save FDAF
core (forward butterfly + frequency-domain gradient) and its CUDA-graph capture
path: the host-sync-free per-block body is captured once and replayed, so wall
time at small ``block_size`` is launch-overhead-bound only on the eager
(``cuda_graph=False``) path.

Two block sizes are tracked, matching ``bench_block_lms``:

* ``bench_block_blind`` (block_size=256) — the launch-overhead-bound stress
  case.  On GPU with graph capture this collapses the per-block kernel launches
  into one replay; a graph regression / silent fallback shows up here as a jump
  back toward the eager loop (a ~7-8x slowdown vs the captured path).
* ``bench_block_blind_large`` (block_size=2048) — the launch-overhead-amortized
  operating point; guards block-size-scaling regressions (per-element work,
  intermediate-tensor growth) that the 256 case would mask.

The blind engine has no CPR and no training prefix, so every full block is
graph-eligible (unlike ``block_lms``, where only decision-directed blocks are).
