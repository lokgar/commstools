"""Benchmarks: block_lms frequency-domain equalizer (DD-02 gate).

Canonical DD-02 workload: ``block_lms/bps+cs/16qam/N1e5/C2`` — BPS CPR with
per-symbol cycle-slip correction enabled, which exercises the per-block
D2H/H2D synchronization points that DD-02 removes.

Two block sizes are tracked:

* ``bench_block_lms`` (block_size=256) — the deliberate stress case: on GPU
  the per-block work is too small to amortize the ~30-50 kernel launches per
  iteration, so wall time is dominated by fixed launch overhead.  This is the
  DD-02 gate workload (kept ID-stable across baselines) and the case CUDA
  graph capture (DD-02 step 3) is meant to rescue.
* ``bench_block_lms_large`` (block_size=2048) — the recommended GPU operating
  point with launch overhead amortized.  Guards against regressions that
  scale with block size (per-element work, intermediate-tensor growth) which
  the overhead-bound 256 case would mask, and provides the throughput ceiling
  that graph capture at small block sizes is judged against.
* ``bench_block_lms_dd`` (block_size=256, short training prefix) — the
  decision-directed steady state, the realistic operating mode and the only
  one that exercises the DD-02 step-3 CUDA-graph path (graph capture covers
  full DD blocks only; the fully-trained ``bench_block_lms`` above runs the
  eager loop because every block is a training block).  This is the headline
  Point-7 number; a graph regression / silent fallback shows up here as a
  jump back to the eager ~800 ms.

``bench_block_lms``/``_large`` pass the full symbol sequence as training, so
they measure the eager loop on both backends regardless of ``cuda_graph``.
