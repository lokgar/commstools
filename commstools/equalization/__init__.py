"""
Adaptive and block channel equalization.

This package provides sequential (LMS, RLS, CMA, RDE) and block / frequency-domain
equalizers with optional carrier-phase recovery, plus linear (zero-forcing) and
pilot-tone polarization-demultiplexing routines. Numba (CPU) and JAX (GPU) kernel
backends dispatch automatically based on where the input data resides.

The public API is unchanged from when this was a single module:
``from commstools.equalization import lms, rls, cma, rde, ...`` continues to work.
