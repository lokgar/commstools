    Least Mean Squares adaptive equalizer with butterfly MIMO support.

    Update modes
    ------------
    The weight-update cadence is selected by ``update_mode`` — the equalizer
    math, regressor windows, slicer, and error are otherwise identical:

    +-----------------------+--------+----------------+----------------------+
    | Mode                  | Domain | Adaptation lag | Use case             |
    +=======================+========+================+======================+
    | ``'sequential'``      | time   | 1 symbol       | fastest dynamics,    |
    | (default)             |        |                | CPU (Numba)          |
    +-----------------------+--------+----------------+----------------------+
    | ``'block'``,          | time   | ``block_len``  | fast dynamics on GPU |
    | ``block_len`` 8-32    |        | symbols        | (JAX/CuPy)           |
    +-----------------------+--------+----------------+----------------------+
    | ``block_lms``         | freq.  | ``block_size`` | throughput king,     |
    | (separate function)   |        | (~256)         | slow/static channels |
    +-----------------------+--------+----------------+----------------------+

    With ``update_mode='block'`` the weights are frozen over ``block_len``
    symbols and one aggregated gradient — exactly the sum of what a
    frozen-weight per-symbol LMS would accumulate over those symbols — is
    applied per chunk, turning ``block_len`` rank-1 updates into a single matrix
    product the GPU can occupy.  ``step_size`` is therefore on the **same scale
    as** ``update_mode='sequential'``: the same ``mu`` yields the same
    convergence and steady-state floor (do **not** divide by ``block_len``).
    Only the *stability ceiling* is ~``block_len``x lower (the weights are
    frozen across the chunk); reduce ``mu`` below your sequential value only if
    the run diverges.  Block mode requires ``backend='jax'`` (chunked
    ``lax.scan``) or ``backend='xp'`` (array-native NumPy/CuPy loop);
    ``backend='numba'`` and ``cpr_type``/``store_weights`` are not supported.

    Supports data-aided (training) and decision-directed (DD) modes.
    When ``training_symbols`` are provided, the equalizer uses them for the
    initial convergence phase, then switches to DD mode using the
    ``modulation`` and ``order`` parameters, or a constellation auto-inferred
    from the training symbols for hard-decision slicing.

    For MIMO inputs ``(C, N)``, a butterfly ``(C, C, num_taps)`` filter
    structure is used so each output is a weighted sum of all input streams,
    enabling cross-channel interference cancellation.

    Algorithm (per symbol n)
    ------------------------
    1. **Sliding input window** — the length-T tap vector for output channel c
       is drawn from the padded input at the strided sample position::

           x_{c',n} = [x_{c'}[n*sps - T_c], ..., x_{c'}[n*sps - T_c + T - 1]]

       where ``T_c`` = ``center_tap`` (default ``T // 2``).  The causal delay
       ``T_c`` is absorbed into the tap vector so the filter can model both
       pre- and post-cursor ISI.

    2. **Butterfly filter** — cross-correlate conjugate weights with the input
       across all C input channels::

           y_c_raw[n] = sum_{c'} w_{c,c'}^H * x_{c',n}

    3. **Carrier phase recovery** (if ``cpr_type`` is set):

       * **PLL** — cross-product phase detector
         ``phi_err = Im(y_raw * conj(d_prev))``
         drives a PI integrator with gains ``K_p``, ``K_i``; accumulated
         phase ``phi_n`` is applied as ``y[n] = y_raw * exp(-j*phi_n)``.
       * **BPS** — ``B`` candidate rotations ``exp(-j*k*pi/(2*B))`` are
         tested; the one minimising the summed nearest-constellation distance
         over the trailing ``K`` = ``cpr_bps_block_size`` symbols is chosen.
         A causal 4-fold unwrap converts the ``[0, pi/2)`` argmin to full-range
         ``phi_n`` stored in a float64 accumulator.

    4. **Decision** — training symbol ``d[n]`` (DA phase, while
       ``n < len(training_symbols)``) or nearest-constellation hard decision on
       ``y[n]`` (DD phase thereafter).

    5. **Error and tap-plane back-rotation**::

           e_clean[n] = d[n] - y[n]
           e_taps[n]  = e_clean[n] * exp(+j*phi_n)

       The back-rotation undoes the CPR correction so the gradient operates in
       the original tap space.

    6. **LMS weight update** (plain, no input-power normalisation)::

           w_{c,c'} += mu * conj(e_taps_c[n]) * x_{c',n}

       Stability bound: ``0 < mu < 2 / (C * T * P_x)`` where ``P_x`` is the
       mean per-tap input power.  The equalizer normalises inputs to unit
       symbol-rate power before adaptation, so ``P_x ≈ 1``.

    7. **Cycle-slip correction** (if ``cpr_cycle_slip_correction=True``) — a
       circular buffer of ``cpr_cycle_slip_history`` past phase values is
       maintained per channel.  An online least-squares linear fit over the
       buffer predicts ``phi_pred_n``.  If
       ``|phi_n - phi_pred_n| > cpr_cycle_slip_threshold``,
       ``phi_n`` is snapped to the nearest ``2*pi/sym``
       multiple (``sym`` = constellation symmetry order, 4 for QAM/QPSK); the
       corrected value replaces ``phi_n`` in steps 5 and 6 and is written into
       the history buffer.

    Parameters
    ----------
    samples : array_like
        Input signal samples. Shape: ``(N_samples,)`` for SISO or
        ``(C, N_samples)`` for MIMO butterfly equalization.
        Typically at 2 samples/symbol for fractionally-spaced equalization.
    training_symbols : array_like, optional
        Known transmitted symbols (at symbol rate, 1 SPS).
        Shape: ``(N_train,)`` for SISO or ``(C, N_train)`` for MIMO.
        If None, pure DD mode (requires ``modulation`` and ``order``).
    num_taps : int, default 21
        Number of equalizer taps per FIR filter. For fractionally-spaced
        equalization (sps > 1), use at least ``4 * sps`` taps.
    sps : int, default 2
        Samples per symbol at the input.  Use ``sps=2`` (T/2-spaced, default)
        for the first equalization stage.  ``sps=1`` is valid for a second
        symbol-spaced stage after FOE + CPR; use a short filter (3-11 taps)
        for residual ISI cleanup.  ``sps > 2`` is accepted but uncommon.
        The equalizer decimates by ``sps`` to produce one output symbol per
        input stride.
    step_size : float, default 0.01
        Plain LMS step size (mu). The gradient is applied directly without
        input-power normalization, matching the convention in Haykin's
        *Adaptive Filter Theory* and most published papers.  Stability
        requires ``0 < mu < 2 / (C * num_taps * P_x)`` where ``P_x`` is the
        mean per-tap input power.  Because inputs are normalized to unit
        symbol-rate power by default, a safe starting range for typical
        settings is ``1e-4`` to ``1e-2``.  Values closer to the upper bound
        converge faster but produce higher steady-state misadjustment.
    modulation : str, optional
        Modulation scheme (e.g., 'psk', 'qam', 'pam') for DD slicing.
        Required if ``training_symbols`` is None.
    order : int, optional
        Modulation order (e.g., 4, 16).
    unipolar : bool, default False
        If True, indicates the modulation is unipolar (e.g., unipolar PAM).
    store_weights : bool, default False
        If True, stores weight trajectory in ``weights_history``.
    device : str, optional
        Target device for JAX computations (e.g., 'cpu', 'gpu', 'tpu').
        Default is 'cpu'. Ignored when ``backend='numba'``.
    center_tap : int, optional
        Index of the center tap. If None, defaults to ``num_taps // 2``.
    backend : str, default 'numba'
        Execution backend. ``'numba'`` compiles the sequential loop with LLVM
        via Numba ``@njit``; typically 2-5x faster than JAX on CPU for
        SISO/small-MIMO signals (no scan serialization overhead).
        ``'jax'`` uses ``jax.lax.scan`` and supports GPU placement and
        automatic differentiation through the equalizer.
        ``'xp'`` is valid only with ``update_mode='block'``: it runs the
        array-native NumPy/CuPy block loop on the input's device (no JAX).
    w_init : array_like, optional
        Initial tap weights. Shape: ``(C, C, num_taps)`` complex64, or the
        SISO short-hand ``(num_taps,)`` / ``(1, num_taps)`` as returned by
        ``EqualizerResult.weights`` for single-channel equalizers.
        If provided, the equalizer warm-starts from these weights instead of
        the default center-tap identity matrix.  Useful for weight handoff from
        a prior stage (e.g. preamble LMS → payload LMS).
        Raises ``ValueError`` if the shape does not match.
    pmf : array_like of float, optional
        Probability mass function over the constellation for probabilistically
        shaped QAM (PS-QAM).  When provided together with ``modulation`` and
        ``order``, the DD slicer constellation is scaled by ``1/sqrt(E_PS)``
        (where ``E_PS = sum_m P(s_m)|s_m|^2`` on the normalised grid) so it
        matches the unit-power normalised equaliser input.  Training symbols
        are left untouched — ``_normalize_inputs`` already brings them to unit
        average power.  Has no effect for uniform modulations.
    cpr_type : {'pll', 'bps', None}, default None
        Inline carrier phase recovery algorithm applied jointly with weight
        updates at every symbol.  ``None`` disables CPR (default, bit-exact
        with the legacy behaviour).

        * ``'pll'`` — 2nd-order decision-directed phase-locked loop.  The
          cross-product phase detector ``Im(y · conj(d))`` drives a PI loop
          with gains derived from ``cpr_pll_bandwidth``.  Low noise floor;
          recommended for QPSK through 64-QAM.
        * ``'bps'`` — Blind Phase Search over ``cpr_bps_test_phases`` candidate
          angles in ``[0, π/2)`` (exploiting 4-fold QAM symmetry), averaged
          over a causal window of ``cpr_bps_block_size`` past y_raw samples.
          Preferred for burst/packet modes where PLL pull-in is impractical.

          **Dual-path output:** the wrapped float32 phase estimate rotates
          ``y_raw`` for the weight update, while the unwrapped float64
          accumulator is stored in ``phase_trajectory``.  The two paths are
          kept separate to prevent float32 rounding errors from accumulating
          in the trajectory over thousands of symbols.

          **4-fold causal unwrap:** the raw BPS ``argmin`` lives in
          ``[0, π/2)``.  A causal unwrap tracks the argmin evolution symbol
          by symbol, adding or subtracting ``π/2`` multiples as needed to
          keep the estimate continuous, then converting to full-range radians.
    cpr_pll_bandwidth : float, default 1e-3
        Normalised loop bandwidth ``B_L · T_s`` for the PLL.  Gains are
        computed as ``K_p = 4 B_L``, ``K_i = 4 B_L²`` (critically-damped
        approximation, ζ=1).  Typical range: ``5e-4`` (low phase noise) to
        ``5e-3`` (high phase noise / fast drift).  Used only when
        ``cpr_pll_mu is None`` (the bandwidth shortcut) and ``cpr_type == 'pll'``.
    cpr_pll_mu : float, optional
        Raw proportional PLL gain ``μ``.  If given, overrides
        ``cpr_pll_bandwidth`` and uses raw PI gains directly; ``cpr_pll_beta``
        then defaults to ``0.0`` (a 1st-order loop).  Leave ``None`` to derive
        critically-damped gains from ``cpr_pll_bandwidth``.  Interchangeable
        with the ``mu`` of ``recover_carrier_phase_pll``.
    cpr_pll_beta : float, optional
        Raw integral PLL gain ``β``.  ``β=0`` ⇒ 1st-order loop (no frequency
        integrator); ``β>0`` ⇒ 2nd-order loop.  Requires ``cpr_pll_mu`` to be
        set (passing ``cpr_pll_beta`` alone raises ``ValueError``).  The
        ``(μ,β) ↔ (B_L,ζ)`` mapping is ``ωₙT = √β``, ``ζ = μ/(2√β)``.
    cpr_bps_test_phases : int, default 64
        Number of candidate phase angles for the BPS search in ``[0, π/2)``.
        Higher values improve phase resolution at the cost of ``B`` extra
        distance evaluations per symbol.  32-64 is sufficient for ≤ 16-QAM;
        use 64-128 for 64-QAM.  Ignored when ``cpr_type != 'bps'``.
    cpr_bps_block_size : int, default 32
        Number of past y_raw samples whose min-distance metrics are summed
        before the BPS ``argmin``.  Larger values reduce noise on the phase
        estimate at the cost of increased latency (``K-1`` symbols).
        ``cpr_bps_block_size=1`` recovers the degenerate single-symbol BPS.
        Ignored when ``cpr_type != 'bps'``.
    cpr_joint_channels : bool, default False
        For MIMO inputs (C > 1): if ``True``, the per-symbol phase estimate
        is computed jointly across all C channels before being applied.

        * **BPS** — the per-candidate distance metrics are summed across
          channels before ``argmin``, giving one shared estimate broadcast
          to all channels.  Reduces estimation variance by ~√C for
          shared-LO transmitter setups.
        * **PLL** — the cross-product phase-error signal
          ``Im(y · conj(d))`` is averaged across channels before the PI
          integrator, so all channels share one phase trajectory.

        When ``False``, each channel runs its own independent estimator.
        Ignored for SISO inputs (C == 1).
    cpr_cycle_slip_correction : bool, default False
        Enable causal cycle-slip detection and correction.  A circular
        buffer of ``cpr_cycle_slip_history`` past phase estimates is
        maintained per channel.  Before each symbol, an online linear
        regression over the buffer predicts the current phase; if the new
        estimate deviates from the prediction by more than
        ``cpr_cycle_slip_threshold``, the estimate is snapped to the
        nearest ``2π/symmetry`` quantum (e.g. π/2 for QPSK/QAM) and the
        buffer is updated with the corrected value.  Disable for
        deterministic parity checks or when the channel is known to be
        slip-free.
    cpr_cycle_slip_history : int, default 100
        Length of the phase-history buffer used for cycle-slip prediction.
        Longer buffers produce a more stable linear-trend fit but are
        slower to adapt when the true carrier frequency drifts.  Ignored
        when ``cpr_cycle_slip_correction=False``.
    cpr_cycle_slip_threshold : float, default π/4
        Maximum tolerated deviation (radians) between the predicted and
        observed phase before a slip is declared.  Should be set to half
        the constellation's angular symmetry quantum (``π/4`` for
        QPSK/QAM).  Ignored when ``cpr_cycle_slip_correction=False``.
    debug_plot : bool, default False
        If True, display a convergence + tap-weight diagnostic plot on exit.
    plot_smoothing : int, default 50
        Moving-average window (symbols) for the MSE convergence curve in the
        debug plot.
    cpr_state : CPRState, optional
        Warm-start CPR state from a previous ``lms()`` call (obtained via
        ``EqualizerResult.cpr_state``).  When provided and the CPR type and
        channel count match, the PLL integrators, BPS unwrap accumulators,
        and cycle-slip buffers are pre-loaded rather than zero-initialized.
        This eliminates the ~5-10 k symbol CPR convergence transient that
        occurs at every block boundary in streaming pipelines.  Pass
        ``None`` (default) to cold-start the CPR from zero.  Ignored when
        ``cpr_type=None`` or when the stored state is incompatible (mismatched
        ``cpr_type``, channel count, or history depth), in which case the
        equalizer falls back to cold-start silently.

        Note: JAX backend: ``cpr_state`` warm-start is not yet supported;
            passing a non-``None`` value raises ``NotImplementedError``.
    input_norm_factor : float or ndarray, optional
        Pre-computed RMS normalization factor from a previous call (obtained
        via ``EqualizerResult.input_norm_factor``).  When provided, the
        ``_normalize_inputs`` step is skipped and this value is used directly
        to scale the input samples and training symbols.  This ensures that
        warm-started weight vectors see the same amplitude regime as the
        block on which they were trained, preventing a gradient scale mismatch
        when signal power drifts slowly between blocks.
        Pass ``None`` (default) to recompute the RMS from the current block.
    samples_prefix : array_like, optional
        Signal history from the end of the previous block, used to eliminate
        the zero-padded leading transient at each block boundary.  Shape:
        ``(≥ pad_left,)`` SISO or ``(C, ≥ pad_left)`` MIMO, where
        ``pad_left = min(center_tap, max(0, num_taps - 1))``.  The last
        ``pad_left`` samples of ``samples_prefix`` replace the leading zeros
        in the tap window so that the first output symbol sees a fully
        populated, real-signal tap vector.  The prefix is normalized by the
        same ``input_norm_factor`` as the main block before being prepended.
        Pass ``None`` (default) for standard zero-padding.  Raises
        ``ValueError`` if the prefix length is less than ``pad_left``.
    pad_mode : {'zeros', 'edge'}, default 'zeros'
        Padding strategy for the leading tap window when ``samples_prefix``
        is ``None``.  ``'zeros'`` (default) prepends ``pad_left`` complex
        zeros, which is the standard causal initialisation.  ``'edge'``
        replicates the first sample of the current block, which can reduce
        the initial amplitude jump at cold start.  Has no effect when
        ``samples_prefix`` is provided.
    update_mode : {'sequential', 'block'}, default 'sequential'
        Weight-update cadence (see the *Update modes* section above).
        ``'sequential'`` updates the weights every symbol (the default; the
        only mode supported by ``backend='numba'``).  ``'block'`` freezes the
        weights over ``block_len`` symbols and applies one aggregated gradient
        per chunk — a matrix product that occupies the GPU — and requires
        ``backend='jax'`` (chunked ``lax.scan``) or ``backend='xp'``
        (array-native NumPy/CuPy loop).  ``cpr_type`` and ``store_weights`` are
        not supported with ``'block'`` (both raise).
    block_len : int, default 16
        Number of symbols per frozen-weight update chunk when
        ``update_mode='block'`` (typically 8-32; ignored otherwise).  Larger
        values amortise launch overhead further but reduce the tracking
        bandwidth proportionally.  ``step_size`` stays on the same scale as
        sequential mode (same ``mu`` ⇒ same steady-state floor); only the
        stability ceiling is ~``block_len``x lower.

    Returns
    -------
    EqualizerResult
        Result container with the following fields:

        * ``y_hat`` — equalized symbol estimates, shape ``(N_sym,)`` SISO
          or ``(C, N_sym)`` MIMO, at 1 SPS (symbol rate).
        * ``weights`` — final tap-weight tensor, shape ``(num_taps,)`` SISO
          or ``(C, C, num_taps)`` MIMO.
        * ``error`` — complex error signal ``e[n] = d[n] - y[n]``, same
          shape as ``y_hat``.
        * ``weights_history`` — tap weights recorded at each symbol (only
          when ``store_weights=True``); shape ``(N_sym, num_taps)`` SISO or
          ``(N_sym, C, C, num_taps)`` MIMO.  ``None`` otherwise.
        * ``phase_trajectory`` — accumulated per-symbol phase estimates,
          shape ``(N_sym,)`` SISO or ``(C, N_sym)`` MIMO.  For BPS, this
          is the causal 4-fold-unwrapped float64 phase.  For PLL, it is
          the PI integrator state accumulated over all symbols.  ``None``
          when ``cpr_type=None``.
        * ``num_train_symbols`` — number of training symbols consumed
          (data-aided phase).
        * ``input_norm_factor`` — the RMS factor used to normalize inputs
          (float).  Store and pass as ``input_norm_factor`` on the next call
          to keep weight magnitudes consistent across block boundaries.
        * ``cpr_state`` — ``CPRState`` snapshot of PLL/BPS/cycle-slip
          integrators after the last symbol.  Pass as ``cpr_state`` on the
          next call to resume CPR without a re-convergence transient.
          ``None`` when ``cpr_type=None``.

        Arrays reside on the same device as the input (NumPy CPU or CuPy
        GPU).

    Warnings
    --------
    **JAX GPU mode is typically slower than CPU for adaptive equalization.**
    LMS is inherently sequential: each symbol's weight update depends on the
    previous weights, so ``lax.scan`` serializes execution even on GPU.
    The per-step arithmetic (a ``num_taps``-length dot product) is far too
    small to saturate GPU compute units, while kernel-launch and
    device-memory-transfer overhead dominate.  In practice, ``device='cpu'``
    is 2-10x faster for typical SISO sequences up to ~100 k symbols.  Use
    ``device='gpu'`` only when the number of MIMO channels (``num_ch``) is
    large enough to amortize GPU launch costs, or when batching many
    independent signals externally.  For CPU-optimal throughput use
    ``backend='numba'`` (the default).

    Recursive Least Squares adaptive equalizer with butterfly MIMO support.

    RLS converges faster than LMS at the cost of higher per-symbol
    complexity (O(num_taps²) for the rank-1 Riccati update vs O(num_taps)
    for LMS).  It maintains an inverse correlation matrix P per output stream.

    Algorithm (per symbol n)
    ------------------------
    Steps 1-5 and 7 are identical to ``lms`` (input windowing, butterfly
    filter output, carrier phase recovery, decision, error + tap-plane
    back-rotation, and cycle-slip correction).  Step 6 replaces the plain LMS
    gradient with a rank-1 Riccati update:

    6. **RLS weight update** — for each output channel c, maintaining the
       inverse input auto-correlation matrix ``P_c`` of shape ``(T, T)``::

           k_c        = (P_c @ x_{c,n}) / (lambda + x_{c,n}^H @ P_c @ x_{c,n})
           P_c        = (P_c - k_c @ x_{c,n}^H @ P_c) / lambda
           w_{c,c'}  += k_c * conj(e_taps_c[n])

       where ``lambda`` = ``forgetting_factor``.  ``P_c`` is initialised to
       ``(1/delta) * I`` (``delta`` parameter).  With ``leakage`` ``gamma > 0``
       the weight update becomes
       ``w = (1 - gamma) * w + k * conj(e_taps)``, which exponentially
       suppresses tap energy in frequency-null subspaces and prevents the
       eigenvalue blow-up that afflicts ``P`` for fractionally-spaced
       (sps > 1) inputs.

    Parameters
    ----------
    samples : array_like
        Input signal samples. Shape: ``(N_samples,)`` or ``(C, N_samples)``.
    training_symbols : array_like, optional
        Known symbols for data-aided adaptation (at symbol rate, 1 SPS).
    num_taps : int, default 21
        Number of equalizer taps per FIR filter.
    sps : int, default 1
        Samples per symbol at the input.
    forgetting_factor : float, default 0.99
        RLS forgetting factor (lambda). Range: (0, 1].
        Values close to 1 give longer memory.
    delta : float, default 0.01
        Tikhonov regularisation coefficient that seeds the inverse correlation
        matrix as ``P₀ = (1/delta) · I``.

        **Physical interpretation.**  RLS recursively refines a running estimate
        of ``Rxx⁻¹``, where ``Rxx = E[x xᴴ]`` is the input auto-correlation
        matrix.  Before any data have been observed, ``P`` must be initialised
        to some positive-definite matrix.  Choosing ``P₀ = (1/delta) · I``
        is equivalent to assuming a fictitious prior with `delta` units of
        regularisation energy per tap — a textbook Tikhonov (ridge) prior on
        the tap vector with regularisation parameter ``delta``.

        **Effect on convergence.**

        * **Large delta** (e.g. 1.0): ``P₀`` is small → the first Kalman gain
          vectors ``k = P x / (λ + xᴴ P x)`` are small → the equalizer adapts
          sluggishly over the first tens of symbols.  Once enough data are seen
          the bias disappears, so this is safe when a long training sequence is
          available and numerical robustness is the priority.
        * **Small delta** (e.g. 1e-4): ``P₀ = (1/delta) · I`` is a large matrix
          → ``k`` is large for the first symbols → the equalizer converges in
          very few symbols but the weight update is dominated by noise on those
          first few observations, potentially requiring more symbols to settle.
          Extremely small values (< 1e-5) risk numerical overflow of ``P``
          before the Riccati update can contract it.

        **Sensitivity to signal power.**  The code normalises input samples to
        unit symbol-rate power before running the Riccati recursion, so
        ``delta`` is expressed in normalised units (≈ noise variance scale) and
        is not sensitive to the raw signal amplitude.

        **Practical guidelines.**

        * **Training-aided mode** (``training_symbols`` provided): the default
          ``delta=0.01`` works well for most symbol rates and SNR regimes.
          Increase toward 1.0 if tap weights oscillate wildly during the first
          training symbols; decrease toward 1e-3 if convergence is slow and
          your training block is short.
        * **Decision-directed (DD) only**: prefer ``delta=1.0`` and rely on the
          forgetting factor to drive convergence, keeping ``P`` bounded.
        * **Fractionally-spaced signals** (``sps=2``, with ``leakage > 0``):
          larger ``delta`` (0.1-1.0) helps counteract the positive-feedback
          tendency of the unbounded ``P`` eigenvalues in the null sub-space.
          Pair with ``leakage=1e-4`` for structural stability.
    leakage : float, default 0.0
        Weight-decay coefficient (γ) applied to the tap vector at every step::

            W ← (1 - γ)·W + k·ē         # leaky weight update
            P ← (P - k·x̄ᴴP) / λ         # standard Riccati (unchanged)

        Weight decay exponentially suppresses tap weights in the null subspace —
        noise-only frequency bands that arise in T/2-spaced (sps=2) signals —
        without inflating ``P``'s eigenvalues.
        A value of ``0.0`` (default) gives standard RLS.
        For fractionally-spaced equalization start with ``leakage=1e-4`` and
        increase if steady-state EVM remains high.
    modulation : str, optional
        Modulation scheme (e.g., 'psk', 'qam', 'pam') for DD slicing.
        Required if ``training_symbols`` is None.
    order : int, optional
        Modulation order (e.g., 4, 16).
    unipolar : bool, default False
        If True, indicates the modulation is unipolar (e.g., unipolar PAM).
    store_weights : bool, default False
        If True, stores weight trajectory.
    device : str, optional
        Target device for JAX computations (e.g., 'cpu', 'gpu', 'tpu').
        Default is 'cpu'. Ignored when ``backend='numba'``.
    center_tap : int, optional
        Index of the center tap. If None, defaults to ``num_taps // 2``.
    backend : str, default 'numba'
        Execution backend. ``'numba'`` uses Numba ``@njit``; LLVM-compiled,
        typically fastest on CPU, particularly for the O(num_taps²) Riccati
        update. ``'jax'`` uses ``jax.lax.scan`` (XLA-compiled, GPU-capable).
    pmf : array_like of float, optional
        Probability mass function for PS-QAM.  Scales the DD slicer
        constellation by ``1/sqrt(E_PS)`` to match the unit-power normalised
        equaliser input.  Requires ``modulation`` and ``order``.
    cpr_type : {'pll', 'bps', None}, default None
        Inline carrier phase recovery applied jointly with weight updates at
        every symbol.  ``None`` disables CPR (default).

        * ``'pll'`` — 2nd-order decision-directed PLL.  The cross-product
          detector ``Im(y · conj(d))`` drives a PI loop with gains from
          ``cpr_pll_bandwidth``.  Low noise floor; suited to QPSK-64-QAM.
        * ``'bps'`` — Blind Phase Search over ``cpr_bps_test_phases``
          candidate angles in ``[0, π/2)``, averaged over a causal window
          of ``cpr_bps_block_size`` samples.  Uses a **dual-path** design:
          the wrapped float32 estimate rotates ``y_raw`` for the Riccati
          update; the unwrapped float64 accumulator populates
          ``phase_trajectory``.  A **causal 4-fold unwrap** converts the
          ``[0, π/2)`` argmin to full-range radians symbol by symbol.
    cpr_pll_bandwidth : float, default 1e-3
        Normalised loop bandwidth ``B_L · T_s`` for the PLL.  Gains are
        ``K_p = 4 B_L``, ``K_i = 4 B_L²`` (critically-damped, ζ=1).  Typical
        range: ``5e-4`` (low phase noise) to ``5e-3`` (high drift).
        Used only when ``cpr_pll_mu is None`` and ``cpr_type == 'pll'``.
    cpr_pll_mu : float, optional
        Raw proportional PLL gain ``μ``.  If given, overrides
        ``cpr_pll_bandwidth``; ``cpr_pll_beta`` then defaults to ``0.0``
        (1st-order).  Leave ``None`` for critically-damped gains from
        ``cpr_pll_bandwidth``.  Interchangeable with the ``mu`` of
        ``recover_carrier_phase_pll``.
    cpr_pll_beta : float, optional
        Raw integral PLL gain ``β``.  ``β=0`` ⇒ 1st-order, ``β>0`` ⇒ 2nd-order.
        Requires ``cpr_pll_mu`` to be set.  Mapping: ``ωₙT = √β``,
        ``ζ = μ/(2√β)``.
    cpr_bps_test_phases : int, default 64
        Number of BPS candidate phase angles in ``[0, π/2)``.  32-64 is
        sufficient for ≤ 16-QAM; use 64-128 for 64-QAM.  Ignored when
        ``cpr_type != 'bps'``.
    cpr_bps_block_size : int, default 32
        Trailing-window length (symbols) summed before the BPS ``argmin``.
        Larger values reduce phase-noise variance at the cost of latency.
        ``cpr_bps_block_size=1`` gives single-symbol BPS.  Ignored when
        ``cpr_type != 'bps'``.
    cpr_joint_channels : bool, default False
        For MIMO inputs (C > 1): share the phase estimate across channels.

        * **BPS** — distance metrics are summed across channels before
          ``argmin``.  Reduces estimation variance by ~√C for shared-LO
          systems.
        * **PLL** — the phase-error signal is averaged across channels
          before the PI integrator.

        When ``False``, each channel has an independent estimator.
        Ignored for SISO inputs.
    cpr_cycle_slip_correction : bool, default False
        Enable causal cycle-slip detection and correction.  A circular
        buffer of ``cpr_cycle_slip_history`` past phase estimates is kept
        per channel.  An online linear regression predicts the next phase;
        if the new estimate deviates by more than
        ``cpr_cycle_slip_threshold``, it is snapped to the nearest
        ``2π/symmetry`` quantum and the buffer is updated.  Disable for
        parity checks or slip-free channels.
    cpr_cycle_slip_history : int, default 100
        Phase-history buffer length for slip prediction.  Longer buffers
        give a more stable trend estimate but adapt more slowly to genuine
        frequency steps.  Ignored when ``cpr_cycle_slip_correction=False``.
    cpr_cycle_slip_threshold : float, default π/4
        Maximum tolerated deviation (radians) before a slip is declared.
        Set to half the constellation's angular quantum (``π/4`` for
        QPSK/QAM).  Ignored when ``cpr_cycle_slip_correction=False``.
    debug_plot : bool, default False
        Display convergence + tap-weight diagnostic plot on exit.
    plot_smoothing : int, default 50
        MSE moving-average window for the debug plot.
    cpr_state : CPRState, optional
        Warm-start CPR state from a previous ``rls()`` call.  See
        ``lms()`` for the full description; behaviour is identical.
    input_norm_factor : float or ndarray, optional
        Pre-computed RMS normalization factor from a previous call.  See
        ``lms()`` for the full description; behaviour is identical.
    samples_prefix : array_like, optional
        Signal history from the end of the previous block.  See ``lms()``
        for the full description; behaviour is identical.
    pad_mode : {'zeros', 'edge'}, default 'zeros'
        Padding strategy when ``samples_prefix`` is ``None``.  See
        ``lms()`` for the full description; behaviour is identical.

          shape as ``y_hat``.
        * ``weights_history`` — tap weights at each symbol when
          ``store_weights=True``; ``None`` otherwise.

        * ``input_norm_factor`` — RMS factor used to normalize inputs.
        * ``cpr_state`` — CPRState snapshot after the last symbol; ``None``
          when ``cpr_type=None``.

    Warnings
    --------
    **Fractional Spacing Singularity:**
    Applying RLS to fractionally-spaced signals (sps > 1) is not recommended.
    Fractional spacing bounds the signal energy within a subset of the Nyquist
    bandwidth. The unexcited frequency bands contain strictly thermal noise,
    rendering the input correlation matrix mathematically singular. RLS
    attempts to invert these near-zero eigenvalues, exponentially amplifying
    high-frequency noise and causing severe tap weight bloat.  Normalized LMS
    is the structurally stable alternative.

    ``w_init`` warms-start the tap weights; the inverse correlation matrix ``P``
    always begins at ``(1/delta) · I`` regardless of ``w_init``.

    """
    Constant Modulus Algorithm blind equalizer with butterfly MIMO support.

    ``update_mode='block'`` (``block_len`` 8-32) freezes the weights over
    ``block_len`` symbols and applies one aggregated Godard gradient per chunk,
    turning the per-symbol update into a matrix product the GPU can occupy.  It
    requires ``backend='jax'`` (chunked ``lax.scan``) or ``backend='xp'``
    (array-native NumPy/CuPy); ``backend='numba'`` and ``store_weights`` are not
    supported.  ``step_size`` is on the **same scale as** sequential mode (the
    aggregated gradient is the sum over the chunk): the same ``mu`` gives the
    same floor — only the stability ceiling is ~``block_len``x lower, so reduce
    ``mu`` only if the run diverges.  Pilot-aided masking carries over unchanged.

    CMA minimizes the Godard dispersion criterion and requires no training
    symbols. It is the standard blind equalizer for constant-modulus signals
    (PSK) and near-constant-modulus signals (low-order QAM).

    CMA recovers the signal up to a phase ambiguity. A phase recovery step
    (e.g. Viterbi-Viterbi, pilot-aided) is typically needed after CMA.

    When ``pilot_ref`` and ``pilot_mask`` are both supplied the equalizer
    switches to a **pilot-aided hybrid** mode: the standard Godard CMA error
    is used at data positions while an LMS residual error
    (``pilot_ref - y``) is used at every pilot position.  This resolves the
    phase ambiguity at pilot locations while preserving blind adaptation
    elsewhere.  Build the dense arrays with ``build_pilot_ref``.

    Algorithm (per symbol n)
    ------------------------
    Steps 1 and 2 are identical to ``lms`` (sliding input window and
    butterfly filter output ``y_raw[n]``).  There is **no CPR step** —
    CMA's cost surface is phase-invariant; no radial error can drive a
    phase rotator (see Notes below).

    3. **Godard error** — third-order radial gradient of the dispersion
       cost ``J = E[(|y|^2 - R^2)^2]``::

           e[n] = (|y[n]|^2 - R^2) * y[n]

       The Godard radius ``R^2 = E[|s|^4] / E[|s|^2]`` is computed once
       from the normalised constellation (defaults to 1 if ``modulation``
       is not given).  The error is purely radial: any constant phase
       rotation of ``y`` leaves ``|y|^2`` and therefore ``e`` unchanged
       up to the same rotation, so CMA cannot resolve the phase ambiguity
       it introduces.

    4. **Weight update** — steepest descent on the Godard criterion (note
       the minus sign, opposite to LMS)::

           w_{c,c'} -= mu * conj(e_c[n]) * x_{c',n}

    **Pilot-aided hybrid** (when ``pilot_ref`` and ``pilot_mask`` are set):
    at pilot positions the Godard error is replaced by the LMS pilot error
    ``e_p[n] = pilot_ref[n] - y[n]``, and the weight update sign flips to
    ``+mu`` (standard LMS gradient ascent toward the reference).  This
    resolves the phase ambiguity at pilot locations while CMA handles data
    positions blindly.

    Notes
    -----
    **Why joint CMA + CPR is not supported:**
    PLL requires a phase-coherent decision ``d[n]`` (nearest constellation
    point) to form the cross-product error ``Im(y * conj(d))``; but CMA
    output has an unknown phase rotation, so the decision is unreliable.
    BPS is blind, but CMA weights converge to one of four equally-valid
    90° rotations and slowly drift between them — BPS would track that
    drift, but the next CMA gradient step would fight the correction.  Use
    the sequential pipeline instead: CMA →
    ``correct_carrier_phase`` (BPS or
    Viterbi-Viterbi) → optional ``lms`` fine-tune.

    Parameters
    ----------
    samples : array_like
        Input signal samples. Shape: ``(N_samples,)`` or ``(C, N_samples)``.
        Typically at 2 samples/symbol for fractionally-spaced equalization.
    num_taps : int, default 21
        Number of equalizer taps per FIR filter.
    sps : int, default 2
        Samples per symbol at the input.  Use ``sps=2`` (T/2-spaced, default)
        for the standard first-stage blind equalization.  ``sps=1`` enables
        symbol-spaced CMA, useful when input is already decimated but phase
        ambiguity resolution is still needed.
    step_size : float, default 1e-3
        CMA step size (mu). Unlike LMS, CMA's cost surface is non-convex and
        higher-order, so input-power normalization distorts the gradient geometry.
        Use a fixed step size in the range 1e-5 to 1e-3 for stability.
    modulation : str, optional
        Modulation type for auto-computing Godard radius R2 (e.g. ``"psk"``, ``"qam"``).
        If None, defaults to R2=1.0.
    order : int, optional
        Modulation order for auto-computing R2.
    unipolar : bool, default False
        Use unipolar constellation for auto-computing R2.
    store_weights : bool, default False
        If True, stores weight trajectory.
    device : str, optional
        Target device for JAX computations (e.g., 'cpu', 'gpu', 'tpu').
        Default is 'cpu'. Ignored when ``backend='numba'``.
    center_tap : int, optional
        Index of the center tap. If None, defaults to ``num_taps // 2``.
    backend : str, default 'numba'
        Execution backend. ``'numba'`` uses Numba ``@njit``; LLVM-compiled,
        typically fastest on CPU. ``'jax'`` uses ``jax.lax.scan``
        (XLA-compiled, GPU-capable).  ``'xp'`` is valid only with
        ``update_mode='block'`` — the array-native NumPy/CuPy block loop.
    w_init : array_like, optional
        Initial tap weights. Shape: ``(C, C, num_taps)`` complex64, or the
        SISO short-hand ``(num_taps,)`` / ``(1, num_taps)`` as returned by
        ``EqualizerResult.weights`` for single-channel equalizers.
        Warm-starts blind equalization from pre-converged weights (e.g. from
        a prior ``lms()`` call on the preamble). Raises ``ValueError`` on
        shape mismatch.
    pilot_ref : (C, N_sym) complex64 array, optional
        Dense pilot reference array — zeros at data positions, known symbols
        at pilot positions.  Build with ``build_pilot_ref``.
        Must be provided together with ``pilot_mask``.
    pilot_mask : (N_sym,) uint8 array, optional
        Pilot position mask — ``1`` at pilot positions, ``0`` elsewhere.
        Build with ``build_pilot_ref``.
    pilot_gain_db : float, default 0.0
        Pilot boosting in dB relative to payload power, matching
        ``SingleCarrierFrame.pilot_gain_db``.  When non-zero, the received
        signal at pilot positions is attenuated by the inverse of the boost
        factor before the global RMS normalisation.  This prevents boosted
        pilots from inflating the RMS estimate and biasing the Godard
        convergence target at data positions.  Set to ``0.0`` when pilots
        are not boosted.
    pmf : array_like of float, optional
        Probability mass function for PS-QAM.  When provided with ``modulation``
        and ``order``, the Godard R2 is computed for the unit-power PS
        distribution ``{s_m/sqrt(E_PS)}``:
        ``R2 = E_PS[|s_m|^4] / E_PS^2``.  Pilot references are also scaled
        by ``1/sqrt(E_PS)`` so pilot-aided and blind sections converge to the
        same unit-power target.
    input_norm_factor : float or ndarray, optional
        Pre-computed RMS normalization factor from a previous call.  See
        ``lms()`` for the full description; behaviour is identical.
    samples_prefix : array_like, optional
        Signal history from the end of the previous block.  See ``lms()``
        for the full description; behaviour is identical.
    pad_mode : {'zeros', 'edge'}, default 'zeros'
        Padding strategy when ``samples_prefix`` is ``None``.  See
        ``lms()`` for the full description; behaviour is identical.
    update_mode : {'sequential', 'block'}, default 'sequential'
        Weight-update cadence.  ``'sequential'`` updates every symbol (the
        default; the only mode for ``backend='numba'``).  ``'block'`` freezes
        the weights over ``block_len`` symbols and applies one aggregated Godard
        gradient per chunk (a GPU-occupying matrix product); requires
        ``backend='jax'`` or ``backend='xp'`` and is incompatible with
        ``store_weights``.  Pilot-aided masking carries over unchanged.
    block_len : int, default 16
        Symbols per frozen-weight chunk when ``update_mode='block'`` (typically
        8-32; ignored otherwise).  ``step_size`` stays on the same scale as
        sequential mode; only the stability ceiling is ~``block_len``x lower.

    Returns
    -------
    EqualizerResult
        Equalized symbols, final weights, CMA error history, and optionally
        weight trajectory.  ``input_norm_factor`` field is populated.

    Warnings
    --------
    **JAX GPU mode is typically slower than CPU for adaptive equalization.**
    CMA is inherently sequential: each weight update depends on the previous
    weights, so ``lax.scan`` serializes execution even on GPU.  Use
    ``device='cpu'`` for typical SISO sequences, or ``backend='numba'`` for
    CPU-optimal throughput.

    Radius Directed Equalizer (RDE) — blind equalizer for multi-ring constellations.

    ``update_mode='block'`` (``block_len`` 8-32) freezes the weights over
    ``block_len`` symbols and applies one aggregated ring-directed gradient per
    chunk.  It requires ``backend='jax'`` (chunked ``lax.scan``) or
    ``backend='xp'`` (array-native NumPy/CuPy); ``backend='numba'`` and
    ``store_weights`` are not supported.  ``step_size`` is on the **same scale
    as** sequential mode (the aggregated gradient is the sum over the chunk):
    the same ``mu`` gives the same floor — only the stability ceiling is
    ~``block_len``x lower, so reduce ``mu`` only if the run diverges.
    Pilot-aided masking carries over to block mode unchanged.

    RDE is a CMA variant that replaces the single Godard dispersion radius with
    per-symbol radius selection from the set of unique constellation ring radii.
    This corrects CMA's fundamental weakness on higher-order QAM: CMA forces
    all symbols toward a single average circle, severely degrading convergence
    when the constellation spans multiple rings (e.g. inner, middle, outer rings
    of 16-QAM).  RDE instead drives each symbol toward its *nearest* ring,
    producing a gradient surface that matches the true constellation geometry.

    Like CMA, RDE is fully blind (no training symbols) and recovers the channel
    up to a **phase ambiguity**.  A carrier-phase recovery step is needed after
    convergence; see ``cma`` Notes for why joint CPR is not supported.

    Algorithm (per symbol n)
    ------------------------
    Steps 1 and 2 are identical to ``lms`` (sliding input window and
    butterfly filter output ``y[n]``).  Like ``cma``, there is no
    CPR step.

    3. **Ring selection** — choose the constellation ring radius closest to
       the current output magnitude::

           R_d[n] = argmin_{r in R_set} |r - |y[n]||
           R_set  = {|c| : c in constellation}

       ``R_set`` is the set of unique ring radii extracted once from the
       normalised Gray constellation.  For 16-QAM this yields three radii
       rather than the single CMA average, eliminating the inward/outward
       pull that degrades CMA convergence on higher-order QAM.

    4. **RDE error** — same third-order form as ``cma`` but using the
       per-symbol ring radius::

           e[n] = (|y[n]|^2 - R_d[n]^2) * y[n]

    5. **Weight update** — steepest descent (same sign convention as CMA)::

           w_{c,c'} -= mu * conj(e_c[n]) * x_{c',n}

    **Pilot-aided hybrid** (when ``pilot_ref`` and ``pilot_mask`` are set):
    identical to ``cma`` — at pilot positions the RDE error is replaced
    by ``e_p[n] = pilot_ref[n] - y[n]`` and the sign flips to ``+mu``,
    resolving the phase ambiguity at those locations.

    Parameters
    ----------
    samples : array_like
        Input signal samples. Shape: ``(N_samples,)`` or ``(C, N_samples)``.
        Typically at 2 samples/symbol for fractionally-spaced equalization.
    num_taps : int, default 21
        Number of equalizer taps per FIR filter.
    sps : int, default 2
        Samples per symbol at the input.  Use ``sps=2`` (T/2-spaced, default)
        for standard blind equalization.  ``sps=1`` is accepted.
    step_size : float, default 1e-3
        RDE step size (mu). Same non-convex gradient geometry as CMA; use a
        fixed step in the range 1e-5 to 1e-3 for stability.
    modulation : str, optional
        Modulation type for constellation construction (``"psk"``, ``"qam"``).
        Required to extract unique ring radii.  If ``None``, falls back to a
        single unit radius (identical to CMA with ``R²=1``).
    order : int, optional
        Modulation order (e.g. 4, 16, 64).
    unipolar : bool, default False
        Use unipolar constellation for radius extraction.
    store_weights : bool, default False
        If True, stores weight trajectory in ``result.weights_history``.
    device : str, optional
        Target JAX device (``'cpu'``, ``'gpu'``). Ignored for ``backend='numba'``.
    center_tap : int, optional
        Index of the center tap. Defaults to ``num_taps // 2``.
    backend : str, default 'numba'
        ``'numba'`` uses Numba ``@njit``; ``'jax'`` uses ``jax.lax.scan``.
        ``'xp'`` is valid only with ``update_mode='block'`` — the array-native
        NumPy/CuPy block loop.
    w_init : array_like, optional
        Initial tap weights. Shape: ``(C, C, num_taps)`` complex64, or the
        SISO short-hand ``(num_taps,)`` / ``(1, num_taps)`` as returned by
        ``EqualizerResult.weights`` for single-channel equalizers.
        Warm-starts blind equalization from pre-converged weights (e.g. from
        a prior ``lms()`` or ``cma()`` call). Raises ``ValueError`` on shape
        mismatch.
    pilot_ref : (C, N_sym) complex64 array, optional
        Dense pilot reference array — zeros at data positions, known symbols
        at pilot positions.  Build with ``build_pilot_ref``.
        Must be provided together with ``pilot_mask``.
    pilot_mask : (N_sym,) uint8 array, optional
        Pilot position mask — ``1`` at pilot positions, ``0`` elsewhere.
        Build with ``build_pilot_ref``.
    pilot_gain_db : float, default 0.0
        Pilot boosting in dB relative to payload power, matching
        ``SingleCarrierFrame.pilot_gain_db``.  When non-zero, the received
        signal at pilot positions is attenuated by the inverse of the boost
        factor before the global RMS normalisation.  This prevents boosted
        pilots from inflating the RMS estimate and biasing the ring-radius
        convergence targets at data positions.  Set to ``0.0`` when pilots
        are not boosted.
    pmf : array_like of float, optional
        Probability mass function for PS-QAM.  When provided with ``modulation``
        and ``order``, the ring radii are scaled by ``1/sqrt(E_PS)`` to target
        the unit-power constellation ``{|s_m|/sqrt(E_PS)}``.  Pilot references
        are also scaled accordingly.  Requires ``modulation`` and ``order``.
    input_norm_factor : float or ndarray, optional
        Pre-computed RMS normalization factor from a previous call.  See
        ``lms()`` for the full description; behaviour is identical.
    samples_prefix : array_like, optional
        Signal history from the end of the previous block.  See ``lms()``
        for the full description; behaviour is identical.
    pad_mode : {'zeros', 'edge'}, default 'zeros'
        Padding strategy when ``samples_prefix`` is ``None``.  See
        ``lms()`` for the full description; behaviour is identical.
    update_mode : {'sequential', 'block'}, default 'sequential'
        Weight-update cadence.  ``'sequential'`` updates every symbol (the
        default; the only mode for ``backend='numba'``).  ``'block'`` freezes
        the weights over ``block_len`` symbols and applies one aggregated
        ring-directed gradient per chunk (a GPU-occupying matrix product);
        requires ``backend='jax'`` or ``backend='xp'`` and is incompatible with
        ``store_weights``.  Pilot-aided masking carries over unchanged.
    block_len : int, default 16
        Symbols per frozen-weight chunk when ``update_mode='block'`` (typically
        8-32; ignored otherwise).  ``step_size`` stays on the same scale as
        sequential mode; only the stability ceiling is ~``block_len``x lower.

    Returns
    -------
    EqualizerResult
        Equalized symbols, final weights, RDE error history, and optionally
        weight trajectory.  ``input_norm_factor`` field is populated.

    Notes
    -----
    **Why RDE outperforms CMA on high-order QAM:**

    For 16-QAM the Godard radius ``R² = E[|s|⁴]/E[|s|²] ≈ 1.32`` (normalized).
    This single target is a poor proxy for the three distinct rings at
    ``|c| ≈ {0.45, 1.00, 1.34}`` (normalized unit-average-power 16-QAM).
    CMA pulls inner-ring symbols outward and outer-ring symbols inward,
    creating a persistent gradient that opposes correct convergence.
    RDE eliminates this bias entirely: each symbol is only attracted to its
    own ring, so the steady-state gradient vanishes at the correct solution.

    **Phase ambiguity:** Both CMA and RDE share the same 90°-symmetric cost
    surface for QAM/PSK.  Use a phase recovery algorithm after blind equalization.

    **GPU note:** RDE is inherently sequential (each weight update depends on
    previous weights), so ``lax.scan`` serializes execution even on GPU.
    Use ``device='cpu'`` for typical SISO sequences, or ``backend='numba'``
    for CPU-optimal throughput.
