"""
Multirate signal processing and resampling.

This module provides high-performance implementations of multirate
operations, including interpolation, decimation, and rational rate
conversion using polyphase filter banks.

Functions
---------
decimate_to_symbol_rate :
    Optimized symbol extraction after matched filtering.
expand :
    Inserts zeros between samples (zero-stuffing).
upsample :
    Increases sampling rate by an integer factor with anti-imaging.
decimate :
    Reduces sampling rate with anti-aliasing filtering.
resample :
    High-level interface for arbitrary rate changes.

Notes on power scaling
----------------------
All rate-changing functions in this module delegate to
``scipy.signal.resample_poly``, which is designed with **unity DC gain**:
a constant-amplitude input produces a constant-amplitude output.

**Bandlimited (pulse-shaped) signals**

For a signal whose bandwidth fits within the new Nyquist band
(i.e. ``signal_bandwidth < fs_out / 2``), the polyphase filter is
effectively transparent — it passes all signal energy and the average
sample power is preserved:

    E[|x_out[n]|^2] ≈ E[|x_in[n]|^2]

This holds regardless of the resampling ratio, rolloff factor, or
signal length (verified for RRC-shaped signals with rolloff 0.01-0.99,
sps_in down to 1.5, and block sizes as short as 64 symbols).

**Consequence for the ``"symbol_power"`` convention**

The ``Signal`` class uses the ``"symbol_power"`` normalization
(``E[|x|^2] = 1/sps``) so that symbol energy ``Es = E[|x|^2] * sps = 1``
is independent of the oversampling factor.  Because ``resample_poly``
preserves sample power while ``sps`` changes, the convention is broken
after any rate change: the actual sample power remains ``1/sps_old``
instead of ``1/sps_new``.

``Signal.upsample``, ``Signal.decimate``, and ``Signal.resample`` correct
for this by applying a deterministic amplitude gain of
``sqrt(sps_old / sps_new)`` when their ``correct_power=True`` parameter
is set (the default).  This correction is **exact** for pulse-shaped
signals because the power-preserving behaviour of ``resample_poly`` is
guaranteed (not statistical).

**Non-bandlimited signals (white noise, arbitrary arrays)**

For a flat-PSD (white-noise) signal, decimation removes the
out-of-band spectral power together with the aliased bandwidth, so
sample power scales as ``up / down``:

    E[|x_out[n]|^2] ≈ (up / down) * E[|x_in[n]|^2]

Upsampling preserves sample power for non-bandlimited signals too
(the anti-imaging filter passes the baseband content unchanged).

If you are passing raw noise or an unfiltered wideband array through
these functions and need to maintain a specific power level, apply
``correct_power=False`` in the ``Signal`` methods and rescale manually,
or use ``helpers.normalize`` after the fact.

    Decimates an oversampled signal to symbol-rate by direct slicing.

    This function should be used **after** matched filtering to extract
    pulse-shaped symbols at 1 sps. It does not apply additional
    filtering, which is correct since the matched filter has already
    performed optimal noise suppression.

    Parameters
    ----------
    samples : array_like or Signal
        Input matched-filtered signal. Shape: (..., N_samples).  When a
        :class:`Signal` is passed, ``sps`` defaults to the signal's integer
        ``sps`` and a new :class:`Signal` at the symbol rate is returned.
    sps : int, optional
        Input samples per symbol (decimation factor).  Required for array
        input; derived from the Signal otherwise.
    offset : int, default 0
        Sampling phase offset in samples [0, sps-1]. Adjust this to
        sample at the peak of the impulse response (center of the eye).
    normalize : bool, optional
        Normalize the output to unit average power (``mean(|x|²)=1``) after
        slicing.  Absorbs channel/equalizer/filter gain uncertainty.  Defaults
        to ``True`` for :class:`Signal` input (the canonical receive path) and
        ``False`` for raw arrays (the unmodified slicing primitive).
    axis : int, default -1
        The axis along which to downsample.
