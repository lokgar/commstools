"""
Carrier phase recovery utilities.

This package provides routines for carrier phase recovery (CPR), including
streaming decision-directed PLL, block-based Viterbi-Viterbi, Blind Phase
Search, MAP Tikhonov-RTS, and pilot-aided methods, along with cycle-slip
correction and phase ambiguity resolution.

The public API is unchanged from when this was a single module:
``from commstools.recovery import recover_carrier_phase_bps, ...`` continues to
work.
