    Zero-phase Wiener smoother for a random-walk (Wiener) carrier phase.

    Optimal minimum-variance estimate of a phase that random-walks with
    per-sample increment variance q (set by the combined laser linewidth)
    observed in white phase-estimation noise of variance r (set by the
    pilot-tone SNR).  Applies the non-causal Wiener filter

        H(w)       = S_phi(w) / (S_phi(w) + r),
        S_phi(w)   = q / (2 - 2*cos(w)),

    in the frequency domain (FFT -> multiply by the real, even H -> IFFT), so it
    is zero-phase (no group delay) and O(N log N).  This is the principled way to
    hit the smallest residual phase std for a given linewidth and pilot SNR — it
    trades tracking lag against additive noise automatically, where a fixed
    extraction bandwidth must be tuned by hand.

    Because it only rescales the phase track (a deterministic, sample-independent
    low-pass), it stays a unit-modulus correction downstream and cannot hide
    excess noise — it is applied to the common pilot phase, never to the quantum
    samples.

    Parameters
    ----------
    phase : (N,) or (C, N) array
        Unwrapped phase track (e.g. from a ``recover_carrier_phase_pilot_tone*``
        function), in radians.
    process_variance : float, optional
        Per-sample phase-increment variance q [rad²].  If omitted it is derived
        as q = 2*pi*linewidth / f_s from ``linewidth`` (combined TX+LO linewidth)
        and ``sampling_rate``.
    measurement_variance : float, optional
        Phase-estimation noise variance r [rad²].  If omitted it is derived as
        r = 1/(2*SNR) from ``tone_snr`` (linear, in-band tone SNR).
    linewidth, sampling_rate, tone_snr : float, optional
        Convenience inputs to derive ``process_variance`` / ``measurement_variance``.
    detrend : bool, default True
        Remove the per-channel mean + linear trend before filtering and add it
        back after.  Recommended: the random-walk PSD diverges at DC, so a raw
        ramp (residual frequency offset) would be distorted; detrending keeps it
        exact.

    Returns
    -------
    array_like
        Smoothed phase, same shape and backend as ``phase``.

    expected phase from up to ``history_length`` past corrected blocks using
    a linear fit.  When the deviation exceeds ``threshold``, the block is

    symmetry : int, default 4
        Rotational symmetry order of the constellation.  Correction quantum
        is ``2π/symmetry``.  Use 4 for all square QAM constellations and BPS
        (which always searches over ``[0, π/2)``).  For M-PSK use ``symmetry = M``.
    history_length : int, default 1000
        Number of past corrected blocks used for linear extrapolation.
        Reduce for short bursts.
    threshold : float, default π/4
        Deviation from the extrapolated phase that triggers a correction.
        ``π/4`` is the midpoint between adjacent correction quanta for 4-fold
        symmetry.

    A MIMO (butterfly) equalizer has a **polarization-permutation ambiguity**:
    it may emit the streams in swapped output order (output 0 carries pol 1,
    etc.) — a perfectly valid demux that per-channel metrics would otherwise
    score as random, since they compare ``output[i]`` with ``ref[i]``.  This
    matches each output stream to the reference stream it actually carries (the
    bijective assignment maximizing the **rotation-invariant** cross-correlation
    magnitude ``|Σ yᵢ · conj(sⱼ)|``) and reorders ``symbols`` to ``ref_symbols``
    order.

    Run this **before** ``resolve_phase_ambiguity`` (it is rotation
    invariant, so the two compose) and before SER/BER.  For a converged
    *data-aided* equalizer the outputs are already pinned to the training order,
    so this is a no-op; it is the robust fix for **blind** equalizers, whose
    output order is arbitrary.  Only a *constant* permutation is resolved — a
    mid-stream swap is an equalizer-tracking issue, not a labeling one.

    """
    Resolves rotational phase ambiguity after blind carrier phase recovery.

    Blind CPR methods (VV, BPS, Tikhonov) cannot distinguish between
    ``symmetry_order`` rotational copies of the constellation.  This function
    tests all candidate rotations, scores each by Symbol Error Rate (SER)
    against the known transmitted symbols, and returns the symbols rotated by
    the best candidate.

    For MIMO inputs each channel is resolved independently — after MIMO
    equalisation the output streams may land on different ambiguity branches.

    Parameters
    ----------
    symbols : array_like
        Received complex symbols after CPR and ``correct_carrier_phase``.
        Shape: ``(N,)`` or ``(C, N)``.
    ref_symbols : array_like
        Known transmitted symbols (unit-average-power normalised).
        Shape: ``(N,)`` or ``(C, N)``.
    modulation : str
        Modulation scheme (case-insensitive): ``'qam'``, ``'psk'``, etc.
    order : int
        Modulation order.
    symmetry_order : int, optional
        Number of rotationally equivalent constellation copies to test.
        Defaults to 4 for QAM (4-fold ``π/2`` symmetry) and ``order`` for
        PSK.  Override for non-standard constellations.
    num_skip_symbols : int, default 0
        Number of leading symbols to exclude from SER scoring.  The applied
        rotation still covers the full input — only the scoring window is
        trimmed.  Useful when the first ``num_skip_symbols`` symbols have not
        yet converged and would bias the rotation choice.  Must be strictly
        less than the total symbol count.
    pmf : np.ndarray, optional
        Symbol PMF of shape ``(order,)`` for PS-QAM.  Forwarded to
        ``ser`` so the diagnostic SER reported in
        the log is unbiased for shaped constellations.  The phase-rotation
        choice itself uses a scale-invariant inner product and does not
        depend on ``pmf``.

    Returns
    -------
    array_like
        Phase-ambiguity-resolved symbols, same shape and dtype as ``symbols``.

    When ``symbols`` is a :class:`Signal`, ``resolved_symbols`` is resolved
    against ``source_symbols`` (using the signal's modulation/order/pmf) and a
    new :class:`Signal` is returned.

    """Correct the static per-channel phase rotation using a reference sequence.

    A rotationally-invariant blind equalizer (CMA, RDE) leaves an arbitrary
    constant phase offset on each output channel — not limited to the discrete
    ``k·π/M`` grid that ``resolve_phase_ambiguity`` tests.  This function
    estimates the continuous rotation per channel via the ML inner-product
    estimator ``θ = -∠(Σ y·s*)`` over a known reference sequence and applies
    the correction to the full symbol block.

    The reference may be shorter than ``symbols`` (e.g. a transmitted preamble
    or the first ``N_ref`` source symbols); estimation uses only the overlapping
    window.

    num_skip_symbols : int, default 0
        Leading symbols excluded from the rotation estimate (e.g. the
